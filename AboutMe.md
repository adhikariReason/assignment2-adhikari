# Reason Adhikari

This is Reason, from Nepal. I am a junior with Computer Science Major in Northwest Missouri State University. I am fond of anything with Artificial Intelligence. I don't have any prior industry experience but I have been working on few of my personal projects. I find Astronomy fascinating so I like to explore things online about technologies used in spacecrafts and possibilities of deep space exploration during my spare time.
